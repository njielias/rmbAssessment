``This code is an implementation of an order book, a list of all buy and sell orders for a financial instrument.

The OrderBook class has two fields: bids and asks. These are maps that store a list of orders for each price level. The bids map stores buy orders, while the asks map stores sell orders. The keys in these maps represent the price level, and the values are lists of orders at that price level.

The OrderBook class has three methods: addOrder, deleteOrder, and modifyOrder.

The addOrder method takes an Order object and adds it to the appropriate map based on its side (buy or sell) and price. If there are already orders at that price level, the new order is added to the end of the list. The updateOrderPriorities method is then called to update the priorities of all orders at that price level.

The deleteOrder method takes an Order object and removes it from the appropriate map. If there are no orders remaining at that price level, the price level is removed from the map. If there are remaining orders, the updateOrderPriorities method is called to update the priorities of all remaining orders.

The modifyOrder method takes an Order object, a new price, and a new quantity. The deleteOrder method is called to remove the existing order from the appropriate map, and the setPrice and setQuantity methods are called to update the order's price and quantity. The addOrder method is then called to add the modified order back into the appropriate map.

The updateOrderPriorities method takes a list of Order objects and sorts them based on their priority (which is initially set to the current time in milliseconds). It then updates the priorities of all orders in the list to be consecutive values starting from the current time in milliseconds.

The print method prints out the current state of the order book by iterating over the bids and asks maps and printing out the price level and list of orders at each level.

The Order class represents an individual order in the order book. It has six fields: id, price, quantity, side, priority, and createdDate. id is a unique identifier for the order, price is the price of the order, quantity is the quantity of the order, side is the side of the order (buy or sell), priority is the priority of the order (which is initially set to the current time in milliseconds), and createdDate is the date and time when the order was created.

The Order class implements the Comparable interface and overrides the compareTo method to compare orders based on their priorities. If the priority of this order is less than the priority of the other order, -1 is returned. If the priority of this order is greater than the priority of the other order, 1 is returned. If the priorities are equal, 0 is returned.

Overall, this implementation of an order book can handle adding, deleting, and modifying orders, and can print out the current state of the order book. The Order class implements Comparable to ensure that orders are sorted based on their priorities, which allows the order book to maintain the correct order for execution.
